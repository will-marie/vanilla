### General

- Keep documentation up to date as features are added
- Review and update MVP checklist and roadmap as milestones are reached
- Ensure all code passes linting and tests before merging to `dev`
- Note: The dev container ensures a consistent environment for all contributors, so onboarding and setup are simplified. Focus on configuration and feature development rather than tool installation.

## Immediate Technical Debt Sprint (2025-05-28)

- Migrate all backend JavaScript files to TypeScript
- Review and expand test coverage for backend and frontend
- Audit and update documentation for all APIs and modules

- [ ] Complete documentation updates from Technical Debt Sprint

### Merge Process

1. Update and verify test coverage:
   - [ ] Backend Jest tests
   - [ ] Frontend Jest tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
2. Prepare merge:
   - [ ] Create temporary merge branch from dev
